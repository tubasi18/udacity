    <h1>THE CREATION OF SPLIT </h1>

      <p>
        The design philosophy behind our maps on VALORANT is relatively simple. We have a wide range of characters with
        an array of abilities who can also wield a multitude of weapons. Instead of trying to create maps that all
        provide an equal number of ideal combat situations for the crazy number of permutations, we instead push each
        map in a specific direction.</p>

      <p>For example, on Bind we ask “what if we remove the middle area of the map (i.e. “Mid”), which typically
        provides flanking opportunities on a traditional two objective map?” How would that affect the way five-player
        teams play defense or how they attack? Can we even build a map that works well with this constraint? This
        becomes the design goal of the map.</p>

      <p>The intent here is not to have a “gimmick” for each map, but instead to center the map around a specific
        gameplay experience that we can create with the map geometry. We also evaluate new map mechanics, such as
        one-way teleporters or ascenders, and see how these can help us achieve this goal.</p>

      <p> With a clear target, we are then able to evaluate if this type of experience works well for VALORANT. If the
        map does not play well when we start playtesting, we can determine if we are just executing on it poorly or if
        our goal is wrong for the game. However, if it’s working well, we can then focus on how to make it better. Each
        map becomes a new challenge for players to solve. This creates gameplay diversity within our map roster while
        allowing certain characters and team compositions to shine.

        As you can imagine, it doesn’t always work out. There are greybox levels (a “greybox” is our earliest playable
        version of a map) that will never see the light of day. On the other hand, some levels have withstood the test
        of time and have gone through literally years of iteration to earn a spot on our final roster.

        Split is one of these experiences.</p>
