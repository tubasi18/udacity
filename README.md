# Landing Page Project

## Project Description

This project is a dynamic landing page that demonstrates the manipulation of the DOM (Document Object Model) using JavaScript. The page consists of multiple sections and a dynamically generated navigation menu. The key features of this project include:

- Programmatically building the navigation menu based on the sections present in the HTML.
- Smooth scrolling to sections when navigation links are clicked.
- Highlighting the section in the viewport while scrolling.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Usage

To use this project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The navigation menu will be automatically generated based on the sections in the HTML. You can click on the navigation links to smoothly scroll to the corresponding section. The section currently in the viewport will be highlighted.

## Dependencies

This project does not have any external dependencies. It uses only vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation and interaction.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `css/styles.css`: The CSS file containing styles for the web page.
- `js/app.js`: The JavaScript file containing the code for DOM manipulation and interaction.
- `README.md`: This README file containing information about the project.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

- **Dynamic Navigation Menu**: The navigation menu is dynamically generated based on the sections in the HTML.
